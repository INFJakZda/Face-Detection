# Face Detection
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.[1] Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.

## Haar Cascade
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
